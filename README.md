# Hybrid Tracking Method (MixFormerV2 x KCF)

The algorithm uses a switch mechanism between two trackers: a fast Correlation Filter (KCF) and an accurate Visual Transformer (MixFormerV2), balancing tracking speed and quality.

### Overview

#### Algorithm

- The system uses **perceptual hashing** to compare the regions of interest (ROIs) from consecutive frames. 
- A high Hamming distance between hash codes indicates significant object movement, prompting a switch from the Correlation Filter to the Transformer.
- The Correlation Filter runs by default, and when it 'starts to lose' the object (determined by the Hamming distance exceeding a threshold), the system switches to the Transformer for more precise tracking.
- After the Transformer corrects the objectâ€™s position, the Correlation Filter is *reinitialized* using the updated bounding box, continuing the hybrid tracking process.

#### Results

- The proposed algorithm can play a crucial role in running on resource-constrained computers that are used on board UAVs or other robots. 
- Experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm can indeed significantly improve the tracking speed relative to current state-of-the-art models without significant loss of quality. 
- On the UAV123 and VisDrone-SOT datasets, it achieved a **59% and 119% speedup** respectively with only a **2-3% decrease in accuracy** compared to MixFormerV2 (experiments were conducted on Jetson Orin).
